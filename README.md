One of the zero-player games that is not interesting if you don't write code! Just kidding, you can play this game with your friends and have a fun time.

### Rules

It is simple for professional programmers and math persons, but what makes these rules challenging?!

- Prints "Fizz", if the number is divisible by 3
- Prints "Buzz", if the number is divisible by 5
- Prints "FizzBuzz", if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
- Otherwise, prints the number
